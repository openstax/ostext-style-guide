    This beautiful cloud of cosmic raw material (gas and dust from which new stars and planets are being made) called the <term class="no-emphasis">Orion Nebula</term> is about 1400 light-years away. That’s a distance of roughly 1.34 × 10<sup>16</sup> kilometers—a pretty big number. The gas and dust in this region are illuminated by the intense light from a few extremely energetic adolescent stars. (credit: NASA, ESA, M.
