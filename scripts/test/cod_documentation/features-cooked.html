In Western culture, the seven days of the week are named after the seven “wanderers” that the ancients saw in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets visible to the unaided eye (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn).</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047971185"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047971185"> </span>In English, we can easily recognize the names Sun-day (Sunday), Moon-day (Monday), and Saturn-day (Saturday), but the other days are named after the Norse equivalents of the Roman gods that gave their names to the planets. In languages more directly related to Latin, the correspondences are clearer. Wednesday, Mercury’s day, for example, is <span class="emphasis"><em>mercoledi</em></span> in Italian, <span class="emphasis"><em>mercredi</em></span> in French, and <span class="emphasis"><em>miércoles</em></span> in Spanish. Mars gives its name to Tuesday (<span class="emphasis"><em>martes</em></span> in Spanish), Jupiter or Jove to Thursday (<span class="emphasis"><em>giovedi</em></span> in Italian), and Venus to Friday (<span class="emphasis"><em>vendredi</em></span> in French).</p><p id="m59788-fs-id1168047236346"><span id="m59788-fs-id1168047236346"> </span>There is no reason that the week has to have seven days rather than five or eight. It is interesting to speculate that if we had lived in a planetary system where more planets were visible without a telescope, the Beatles could have been right and we might well have had “Eight Days a Week.”</p></div></div>
