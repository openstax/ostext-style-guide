/**

  Limitations
  =========

  One of our methods of improving access to education is lowering cost, and in our effort to do so we have adopted methods of textbook production which many may find unfamiliar. We rely heavily on technology that provides automated content layout and composition for print. This allows us to quickly change content and style, but it also leads to many unique problems. We will investigate some of those problems in detail.

  A list of GitHub Issues which relate to these platform limitations [is maintained using a status:wontfix label](https://github.com/Connexions/oer.exports/issues?q=label%3Astatus%3Awontfix+is%3Aclosed).

  Page count
  ---------

  A large factor in textbook cost is the length of the text, and we have made the decision to sacrifice the quality of our layout and composition in order to lower student cost by reducing page count. This means that if a text is too long to print, we will adjust the style to lower the page count -- usually resulting in a lower quality textbook. Vertical space is extremely valuable, and should never be wasted. With regards to breaking this rule, only the most vital pedagogical features will be considered.

  Our hardcover textbooks are limited to 1700 pages. We prefer a page count considerably lower, to increase accessibility and affordability.

  While we acknowledge that white space, or negative space, is an active element in a good design, we have traded manual control of this type of pixel-perfect layout for software algorithms that place content into a paged layout quickly. This means that adding or removing whitespace can be difficult, or impossible, especially where content breaks across pages or where it has been set into multiple columns.

  Column Layouts
  ---------

  Only specific content, such as collated material, can be organized into columns. The primary body text of each chapter is limited to one column. Markup and instruction will be provided in a tagging legend if a title supports organizing content into a column layout.

  Text wrapping
  ---------

  Our platform does not support wrapping text around images.

  Math and scientific notation
  ---------

  Our publishing platform does not completely support the features of the MathML language. We cannot use colors, certain roots outside the radical, or many features of vertical math. We have  documented [MathML Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7FBfN1twn-7cnNNems0NjdVRlk/view?ts=589232d3) to help avoid some of these problems or introducing others.

  Page breaking
  ---------

  * Any kind of forced page breaks should be kept to a minimum. Without the ability to control placement of each piece of content individually, forcing elements such as tables or other varying length content to break will lead to unintended white space on a page and potentially increase page count significantly. Limiting forced page breaks also helps avoid problems if content is reused.
  * Chapters, appendices, and some collated material will appear after an automatic page break that will force such content to appear on an odd, right hand side, page.
  * Content is allowed to break within tables unless otherwise specified.
  * Content is allowed to break inside a feature unless otherwise specified.
  * Restrictions to natural content breaks may occur in exercises, examples, or other content. End of chapter material might have specific page breaking rules to ensure that exercise titles remain with the exercise problems. Sometimes breaks will be forced so that exercises flow evenly when in columns. These typically depend on the complexity of the layout and/or content.

  Color
  =========

  OpenStax textbooks are primarily in four subjects: Mathematics, Science, Business, and Humanities. There are four general "themes" that specify the style for our titles in these markets.

  Themes

  ### Mathematics

  ### Science

  ### Business

  ![Business Theme](assets/img/color-business-theme.jpg)

  ### Humanities


  Source Art
  ---------

  Source art should use colors from the primary palette from a specific markets theme.

  Art
  =========

  For art, general label for graphs, standard text (descriptions, labels, etc.), and numerals within the images should be Noto Sans. Any math numerals/symbols should be in [STIX](#/general-composition/typography/#mathematics). Size should vary based on size of the art. [Font size](#/general-composition/typography/#typography) should be no smaller than 8pt.

  Typography
  =========

  [A double-stranded scale (Perfect Fifth and Perfect Fourth)](http://www.modularscale.com/?1&em&1.5,1.333&web&text) is used to determine text sizes.

  Base font size can be changed during production for a number of reasons, the most common being textbook length. Longer titles may require text to have less leading, or a smaller font size. Limiting text sizes to specific ratios, and determining vertical spaces relative to that text size, ensures that we can change text properties in a predictable way. All vertical spaces will adjust at the same ratios as text sizes change.

  Vertical Composition
  ---------

  Typography is vertically composed into a space that is divided into measures of the unit of "baseline height".

  Baseline height is the font size of the primary text combined with any leading. Leading in this sense is identical to the line-height property of the CSS specification when provided a Number data type as a value, meaning that this number should be multiplied by the font size -- (base font size * leading). Using the scale example above, the following example shows the composition of text using a base font size of 9px and leading of 1.5, producing a baseline height of 13.5px.

  When elements such as titles are added, any required padding/margin will be added in amounts that maintain text starting in new paragraphs on an integer multiple of the base line height. When a new paragraph begins, it should always vertically position on this base line height. In the following example, a title is added.

  When fonts need to be used together composition will still be focused on the base line height of the primary text. In this case each line will not sit on a base line, instead the accompanying text will sit on a base line at regular intervals.

@Section
  Image Layout
  =========

  Format
  --------

  The original design files of all images/figures should be provided in AI, EPS, or PSD. For vector graphics EPS format is preferred.

  Export settings
  ----------

  ### JPEG

  All JPEGs including splash pages should be exported at 200DPI.

  + **Color model:** CMYK
  + **Quality:** 8
  + **Compression method:** Baseline
  + **Resolution:** 200DPI
  + **Anti-aliasing:** Type Optimized(Hinted)

  Size
  ---------

  ### Width

  Images should be 2.1667in, 3.25in, or 6.5 inches wide. They should be cropped to one of these sizes, or extra white space should be added to the sides so that they fit into one of the width containers outlined here.

  ### Height

  Any extra whitespace at the top and bottom of figures should be cropped off. This cropping should not affect the content of the image.

  Note: OpenStax does not restrict image height if the height is necessary for the context of the subject. We do recommend not using tall images, to reduce page count.

  ![](assets/img/image-rules-content-area.jpg)

  Multi Column Support
  ----------------

  OpenStax does not currently support a multiple-column format, but in some cases we can allow a 2- or 3-column image.
  As long as the source art is one of the 3 sizes we require, the padding applied on these inline elements will shrink the images to fit the content.

  Note: Shrinking the images using our scale rule should not distort content that may appear in source art as long as the font sizes used in such images follow our font-size rules.

  ![](assets/img/image-rules-inline-2-col.jpg)

  ![](assets/img/image-rules-inline-3-col.jpg)


  Nesting
  --------

  ### Padding

  OpenStax adds equal padding (top, right, bottom, and left) to all features. This keeps content, including full-width images, from displaying at full width
  Our padding method uses a scale value that changes based on the font size, leading and line height properties.
  Adding both padding and the css rule `box-sizing: border-box` will resize the image to fit the  content.

Figures may have captions (the markup `<caption>` goes inside the figure tag), but they are not required.

  Figure Caption
  ------------

  Figures that have captions of 70 characters or fewer will allow the caption to fit within image dimensions as shown in sample A. The `<figure>` tags of these should use `class=“small”`. Otherwise captions will be the full width of the page.

  _Note: The 70 characters do not include the figure title or figure number; they are in addition to the title and number of the image._

/**

  Tables
  =========

  +  **Basic tables** are are numbered by default. Tables may have a title and/or a caption. The title appears after the table number and before the caption below the table.
  + To **remove the numbering** from a table, both apply the class="unnumbered" in the `<table>` tag and include an empty label tag (marked up as `<label/>` enclosed by the table tag).
  + To create a table with a **header row**, include a `<thead>` row before the other rows. Header rows are incompatible with a forced "Title" above a table within the same book.
  + To create a **forced "Title" above** a table instead the normal table title below it, merge the cells in the header row and put the "Title" in the merged cell. Tables with forced titles above the data can contain a caption, but no `<title>` tag is needed.  These tables can be unnumbered. Forced titles above the data are incompatible with single header rows within the same book.
  + To create a **forced "Title" above a table _with_ a header row**, use two `<thead>` rows, with the first one's cells merged. These tables can contain a caption, but no `<title>` tag is needed. Two-thead tables are incompatible with double-header-row tables within the same book.
  + To create a table with **two header rows**, use two `<thead>` rows, unmerged. These tables may have a caption and a title. They are incompatible with tables that have both forced "Title" rows above them and a header row, within the same book.
  + **Unstyled** tables use the class "unstyled" in conjunction with the class "unnumbered" (the markup is `<table class="unnumbered unstyled">`). These have no borders or styling and are aligned left by default.
  + To create a **column header** in a table, use the class "column-header" on the `<table>` tag.
  + To create **"header" rows inside a table**, merge the cells in the row and bold the text in the markup for the merged cell. More styling, such as colored text or colored background of the cells, is not supported by the platform.

  Modules
  -------

  Each chapter contains an introduction module. This module must use the class "introduction" (not "intro", which is a common markup mistake) in the document tag: `<document class="introduction">`. A chapter also contains one or more other modules. These are contained in a subcollection inside the collection structure. Modules may contain any available CNXML content.

  ----------

  At the beginning of each chapter in the introduction module, a figure with the splash class (markup: `<figure class="splash">` may cover the horizontal width of the page.

  Chapter Outline
  ------------

  The platform generates a chapter outline for each chapter in the collection.

  Learning Objectives
  -------------

  At the beginning of each chapter, and also at the beginning of each module, learning objectives are defined in the content, using a section with the class learning-objectives (the beginning of the module is marked up this way: `<section class="learning-objectives">`, with a bulleted list of objectives inside the section tag).

  End-of-Chapter Collated Elements
  ---------------

  + Collating elements are created by adding a specific class to a `<section>` tag at the end of a module (these elements must always appear in the same order in the module markup). Collating elements common to most OpenStax books include Section Summary (class="section-summary"), Key Terms (class="key-terms"), Key Concepts (class="concepts"), Key Equations, various types of problems and exercises (often separated in collation by type). More flexible book-specific collated elements sometimes include Practice Tests and [References](/#/book-skeleton/references).
  + Collating elements are usually located inside the relevant modules and collated together at the end of the chapter, using a collation instruction in the introduction module of each chapter. The collated elements may be separated by headers indicating the module they came from, or they may not, according to their class.
