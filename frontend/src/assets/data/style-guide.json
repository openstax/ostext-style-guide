We rely heavily on technology that provides automated content layout and composition for print. This allows us to quickly change content and style, but it also leads to many unique problems. We will investigate some of those problems in detail.</p>\n<p>A list of GitHub Issues which relate to these platform limitations <a href=\"https://github.com/Connexions/oer.exports/issues?q=label%3Astatus%3Awontfix+is%3Aclosed\">is maintained using a status:wontfix label</a>.</p>\n<h2>Page count</h2>\n<p>A large factor in textbook cost is the length of the text, and we have made the decision to sacrifice the quality of our layout and composition in order to lower student cost by reducing page count. This means that if a text is too long to print, we will adjust the style to lower the page count -- usually resulting in a lower quality textbook. Vertical space is extremely valuable, and should never be wasted. With regards to breaking this rule, only the most vital pedagogical features will be considered.</p>\n<p>Our hardcover textbooks are limited to 1700 pages. We prefer a page count considerably lower, to increase accessibility and affordability.</p>\n<p>While we acknowledge that white space, or negative space, is an active element in a good design, we have traded manual control of this type of pixel-perfect layout for software algorithms that place content into a paged layout quickly. This means that adding or removing whitespace can be difficult, or impossible, especially where content breaks across pages or where it has been set into multiple columns.</p>\n<h2>Column Layouts</h2>\n<p>Only specific content, such as collated material, can be organized into columns. The primary body text of each chapter is limited to one column. Markup and instruction will be provided in a tagging legend if a title supports organizing content into a column layout.</p>\n<h2>Text wrapping</h2>\n<p>Our platform does not support wrapping text around images.</p>\n<h2>Math and scientific notation</h2>\n<p>Our publishing platform does not completely support the features of the MathML language. We cannot use colors, certain roots outside the radical, or many features of vertical math. We have  documented <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7FBfN1twn-7cnNNems0NjdVRlk/view?ts=589232d3\">MathML Guidelines</a> to help avoid some of these problems or introducing others.</p>\n<h2>Page breaking</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Any kind of forced page breaks should be kept to a minimum. Without the ability to control placement of each piece of content individually, forcing elements such as tables or other varying length content to break will lead to unintended white space on a page and potentially increase page count significantly. Limiting forced page breaks also helps avoid problems if content is reused.</li>\n<li>Chapters, appendices, and some collated material will appear after an automatic page break that will force such content to appear on an odd, right hand side, page.</li>\n<li>Content is allowed to break within tables unless otherwise specified.</li>\n<li>Content is allowed to break inside a feature unless otherwise specified.</li>\n<li>Restrictions to natural content breaks may occur in exercises, examples, or other content. End of chapter material might have specific page breaking rules to ensure that exercise titles remain with the exercise problems. Sometimes breaks will be forced so that exercises flow evenly when in columns. These typically depend on the complexity of the layout and/or content.</li>\n</ul>", "Number": "'1.3.0'"}, {"!text": "<h1>GENERAL COMPOSITION</h1>", "Number": "'2.0.0'"}, {"!text": "<h1>Color</h1>\n<p>OpenStax textbooks are primarily in four subjects: Mathematics, Science, Business, and Humanities.

Vertical space, padding or margin, will be determined using a method that will ensure that all text is composed in such a way that vertical space is divided into portions equal in height to the product of font size and line height.</p>\n<p>All text will land on a vertical position that is an integer multiple of (base font size * base line height). Base font size, as well as line height, can be changed during production for a number of reasons, the most common being textbook length. Longer titles may require text to have less line height, or a smaller font size. Limiting text sizes to specific ratios, and determining vertical spaces relative to that text size, ensures that we can change text properties in a predictable way. All vertical spaces will adjust at the same ratios as text sizes change.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"OpenStax Typographic Scale\" src=\"assets/img/typography-chart.png\" /></p>\n<h2>Fonts</h2>\n<p>Our books generally use a combination of Noto Sans, Noto Serif, and Dosis.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Noto Sans, Noto Serif</li>\n<li>Dosis, Noto Sans</li>\n<li>Dosis, Noto Serif</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mathematics</h2>\n<p>Mathematics is rendered using <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/stixfonts/\">STIX Fonts Project</a> fonts.
